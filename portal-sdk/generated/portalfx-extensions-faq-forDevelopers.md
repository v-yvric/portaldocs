<a name="sslCerts">How do I use SSL certs?</a>

 Use a wildcard SSL cert for each environment to simplify maintenance, for example,   ``` *.{extension}.onecloud-ext.azure-test.net  ``` or  ``` *.{extension}.ext.azure.com) ``` .    To simplify overall management when your team is building separate, independent extensions, you can also use  ``` {extension}.{team}.ext.azure.com ``` and create a wildcard SSL cert for  ``` *.{team}.ext.azure.com ```. Internal teams can create SSL certs for DogFood using the SSL Administration Web page that is located at [http://ssladmin](). 
    
 Production certs must follow your organizationâ€™s PROD cert process. 

 NOTE: Do not use the SSL Admin site for production certs.
