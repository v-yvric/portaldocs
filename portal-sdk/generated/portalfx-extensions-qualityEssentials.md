## Quality Essentials

Quality Essentials  and 1CS provide access to manage the release policies and procedures for each compliance. QE tracks the following policies.
* Accessibility
* Global readiness
* Global trade compliance
* License terms
* Open source software
* Privacy
* Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)
* Software integrity

Some of the procedures such as Accessibility, GB Certificate, Privacy, and Security are also measured in the Service Health Review Scorecard that is located at [https://aka.ms/shr](https://aka.ms/shr), and in the exit criteria for management review and tracking. 

These requirements apply to both the portal fx and extensions. Since Fx provides the common infrastructure and UI controls that govern the data handling and UX, hence some of the compliance work for extensions would be identical across in Ibiza, and rationally be mitigated by the Framework. For example, Accessibility support on keyboard navigation and screen reader recognition, as well as the regional format and text support to meet globalization requirements, are implemented at the controls that Framework distributed.  The same is true for Security threat modeling, extension authentication to ARM, postMessage/RPC layer and UserSettings, etc. are handled by Framework. To minimize the duplicate efforts on those items, Fx provides some level of "blueprint" documentation that can be used as a reference for compliance procedures. You are still responsible to go through the tools and submit the results for approval previous to shipping your extension.
